# P42WDF
calculate any point in time or space using this simple formula

Pi * X² * V / (Pi * 3 / 9) * ((42³ / 3600) + ((42/100) + 3)) = (360^360) / ((Pi^42 * 9 * V) * ((Pi - 3) * (-X² * V)))

You must be Super Smart to use this formula, once you solved the riddle you'll be able to fly for real! whoooo!
